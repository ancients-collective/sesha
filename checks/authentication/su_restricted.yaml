description: Verify that /etc/pam.d/su requires membership in the wheel or sudo group to use su, preventing unprivileged users from attempting root authentication.
severity: medium
category: authentication
supported_os:
  - linux
tags:
  - cis-benchmark
  - privilege-escalation
  - access-control

steps:
  - function: file_contains
    args:
      path: /etc/pam.d/su
      pattern: "^\\s*auth\\s+required\\s+pam_wheel\\.so(\\s|$)"

impact: |
  Without pam_wheel.so, any local user can attempt su to root. This enables brute-force password guessing against the root account with no rate limiting beyond PAM defaults. In shared or multi-tenant environments, this significantly increases the attack surface for privilege escalation.
explain: |
  The pam_wheel.so module restricts su usage to members of the wheel group (or sudo group on Debian-based systems). When configured as "auth required", PAM rejects su attempts from users not in the group before even prompting for a password. This is a CIS Level 1 recommendation for all Linux distributions.
likelihood: possible
break_risk: |
  Enabling pam_wheel.so means only wheel/sudo group members can use su. Users who currently rely on su but are not in the wheel group will lose access. Verify group membership before applying. Sudo access is not affected by this change.
remediation: |
  Uncomment or add the pam_wheel.so line in /etc/pam.d/su:
    auth required pam_wheel.so
  On Debian/Ubuntu, use the sudo group instead:
    auth required pam_wheel.so group=sudo
  Verify the user is in the correct group:
    groups <username>
  Add a user to the wheel group if needed:
    usermod -aG wheel <username>
